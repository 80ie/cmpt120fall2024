# CMPT 120, Fall 2024

Due dates, marks, discussions, etc. are all on Canvas.

I recommend you use [the Mu Python editor](https://codewith.mu/) to run your
Python programs. It's easy to use, and comes with all the libraries you'll need
for this course.

## Lecture Notes (Fall 2024)

**NOTE**: Dates are inaccurate and will be updated soon for the Fall 2024
semester.

Most of the notes are written in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). [See
here for an
overview](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ThinkPython/blob/v3/chapters/jupyter_intro.ipynb)
if you are unfamiliar with notebooks.

They are easy to read on the web in a couple of ways:

1. Directly through their github web links. Just click on the Github link, e.g.
   [lecture 1](lectures/lecture1/lecture1notes.md).
2. Using the [Jupyter notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Paste the
   github link into the viewer.

**You don't need to install notebook software on your own computer**. But if you
want to, then probably the easiest approach is to use [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You will need a (free) Google
account to use it. Open the notebooks in [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), e.g. you have the option of opening
them from Github URLs. Then you can save your own copies in [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) that you can run and edit. [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides all the Python libraries you
are likely to ever need, and you can run cells online.
