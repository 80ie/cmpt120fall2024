## Lecture Notes (Fall 2024)

Most of the notes are written in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). [See
here for an
overview](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ThinkPython/blob/v3/chapters/jupyter_intro.ipynb)
if you are unfamiliar with notebooks.

They are easy to read on the web in a couple of ways:

1. Directly through their github web links. Just click on the Github link, e.g.
   [chapter 0](textbook/chap00.ipynb).
2. Using the [Jupyter notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Paste the
   github link into the viewer.

**You don't need to install notebook software on your own computer**. But if you
want to, then [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is probably
easiest. You will need a (free) Google account to use it. You can open notebooks
interactively in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Then you
can save your own copies in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
that you can run and edit. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
provides all the Python libraries you are likely to ever need, and you can run
cells online.
