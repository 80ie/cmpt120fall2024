Run that and explore it a\n","  bit. It's a good editor for your first time using Python, and will be fine for\n","  this course.\n","  - You can, run Python in other ways, e.g. in [VS\n","    Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or online using sites like [Google\n","    Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Github\n","    Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or\n","    [replit](https://replit.com/). For this course, running Python in IDLE is\n","    completely fine.\n","  - To open Python notebooks (such as this one!) in Google Colab:\n","    - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n","    - In the File menu, choose \"Open notebook\" (or type ctrl-*O*).\n","    - In the dialog menu that pops up, choose \"Github >\".\n","    - Enter this URL and then click the little magnifying glass:\n","      [https://github.com/tjd1234/cmpt120fall2024](https://github.com/tjd1234/cmpt120fall2024)\n","    - The notebook files should appear in the box. Click on the one you want to\n","      view.\n","    - If you want to save or make changes to notebooks, you need be logged in to\n","      your Google account when you do the above steps.\n","- Follow along in the lectures, and you'll learn everything you need to start on\n","  the road to becoming a programmer and computer scientist."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## A Brief History of Computers and Programming"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["- **1930s**:\n","  - [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) proved,\n","    mathematically, that there are computational problems that program can\n","    solve.\n","  - For example, [the Halting\n","    Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)]: given a program\n","    and some input, will the program eventually stop on that input?
